'4 fish fillets (best if you use a firm, dense fish like halibut, sea bass or snapper)
1 bunch fresh cilantro, cut into large pieces (you may substitute fresh parsley or basil if you prefer)
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into long thin strips
5 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
3 large dried red chili peppers
1/4 tsp turmeric
1 1/2 cups water
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp paprika (heaping)
Salt and pepper to taste',

'1.For this recipe, you will need a sauté pan, it’s like a wide, deep skillet with higher sides. Before you start cooking, reserve a few pieces of the cilantro for garnish.
2.Place cilantro, bell pepper slices, garlic and chili peppers in the bottom of the pan to create a “bed” for the fish.
3.Place fish fillets on top of the other ingredients. Season fillets generously with salt and pepper, then sprinkle turmeric evenly across fillets.
4.Add 1 ½ cups of water to the pan. Cover pan, turn flame on high, and bring to a boil. As soon as the water boils, reduce heat to medium and uncover the pan. Mixture should be simmering lightly at this point. Allow mixture to simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes, basting fillets periodically, until the water reduces by half and turns yellow.
5.In a small bowl, mix together olive oil and paprika with a fork. Pour red oil mixture over the fish fillets, coating them evenly. Let the fish simmer uncovered for 20 minutes more, basting frequently. Fish is done when liquid is reduced to about a quarter of what it was originally, and the fish has turned a rich red color.
6.Serve fish and bell peppers together with the grain and/or vegetable of your choice. I like to serve it with a starch like mashed potatoes (or couscous, if it’s not Passover); the red sauce from the pan can be poured over the top of the fish and the potatoes. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
7.You can create some interesting variations on this recipe by changing the ingredients in the bottom of the pan (the “bed” for the fish fillets). Try peeled lemon slices (no peel or the fish will turn bitter), carrot sticks, garbanzo beans with red chili pepper flakes, or pitted green olives. Enjoy!',
