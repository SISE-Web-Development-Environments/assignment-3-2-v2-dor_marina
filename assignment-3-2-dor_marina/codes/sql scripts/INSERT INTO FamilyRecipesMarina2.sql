'1.You can peel or leave the skin on the potatoes. Grind them with a hand grater or food processor.
2.Add the egg, chopped onion, flour and salt and pepper.
3.Hand mix the ingredients using a spoon or fork. If the mixture seems too dry you can add another egg, but this will alter the texture of the pancake. We prefer a drier mix.
4.Add coconut oil or olive oil to the cast iron pan. We like to use a cast iron pan for even heat.
5.Spoon a small amount of the mixture into a hot pan and gently flatten and shape each into a pancake.
6.Fry until golden brown on both sides. You should only have to flip the pancake once.
7.est served with sour cream.',
